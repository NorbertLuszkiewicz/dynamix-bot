# Hello Node

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) is a popular runtime that lets you run JavaScript on the server instead of in a browser. This project uses the [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) framework to explore basic templating with [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) and submitting data using forms and querystrings.

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That’s this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

← `public/style.css`: The styling rules for your pages and posts.

← `server.js`: The main server script for your new site.

← `src/`: This folder holds the main template for your site along with some basic data files.
